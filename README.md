# HORSIN' AROUND
A truly revolutionary horse racing simulator were you can simulate your races with fun little chess pieces. But our horses are more than just pieces. They're customisable with a wide selection of accessories. Randomise your horses name from a selection of 250. 250!! The possibilities are endless!
## Running Part1
Simply run the HorseRaceSimulator.java file and you will get a horse race printed in the terminal.

## Running Part2
Run the HorsinAround.java file. Alternatively you can run the HorseGraphics.java file. No new fonts or extra files need to be installed. 

## Extra Stuff
A challenge for the user: find the easter eggs hidden in the program without looking through the code. And remember to keep horsin' around!
